nav bar size is 685 x 20
total text size is 491
available space is 194
lead off is 22
end is 5
white bar is 1 x 9 or 1 x 10
height above/below is 5 pixels...

Thus, we have 22 to lead, then 194 - 22 - 5 = 167 for spacing

Total spaces are 8, thus 167/8 = 20.875, so make front lead off 21, and
    we have 21 space between words.

Do 1 pixel for white, 5 to edge of word, word, then 15 to trail...

172+22 = 194
