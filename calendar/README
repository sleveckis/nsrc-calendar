Migration project to move from PHP 5.3 on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to PHP 5.5
on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Next move will be to PHP 7 on Ubuntu 16.04, or above.

Initial email to David Gustafson - We'll use this to create a proper readme:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I've set stuff up so that the web environment simulates what happens on
https://nsrc.org/.

If you go to http://lamp-dev/nsrc.org/calendar you will get the main
page and it loads fine. I've renamed everything in all the php scripts
and includes to match up with the current directory structure.

So, at this point the goal is to make the remaining key php scripts run
and to skin them like what you see at

http://lamp-dev.nsrc.org/calendar/

which corresponds to:

/var/www/calendar/index.php

The critical scripts to update are:

/var/www/calendar/scripts/*
/var/www/calendar/organizers/*
/var/www/calendar/helpfiles/*
/var/www/calendar/ical

You may not need to touch all the files in helpfiles.

For ical we can wait. I need to look at that and think through how I
want to change that.

And, finally, any of the /var/www/calendar/include files as needed going
forward. Not all files will need updating.

I would probably start by going over the initial calendar page:

https://lamp-dev.nsrc.org/calendar/

and pick a script that is not working and work on that. Maybe, for
instance,

/var/www/calendar/helpfiles/workshop_info_main.php

As this is what displays indiviual calendar entry information and should
be fairly easy to make work.

As you'll see you are likely just needing to remove all the
$_HTTP_SESSION_VAR references and use GET instead and remove (in most
cases) the calls to HTMLSPECIALCHARS as GET does this for you.
