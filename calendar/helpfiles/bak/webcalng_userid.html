Here is our reasoning behind not using your ISOC Workshop Rescource Centre userid for this calendar software:
<ul>
<li>This calendar software was purchased with the idea in mind that workshop organizers might use it to help collaborate among a group the details planning a workshop or upcoming event.</li.
<li>The members of this group of organizers may or may not have userids at this site.</li>
<li>Requiring each person that you may wish to invite to use your calendar to register on this site is superfluous if they do not plan on using any of the other functionality of the ISOC Workshop Resource Centre.</li.
<li>By allowing you to create userid/password pairs you have greater control over calendar use. If you choose to create a closed calendar, then you can give users who already have a webcalng Calender userid access to your calendar, and you can create userids for other members of your group who you wish to grant access to the calendar.</li>
<li>Additionally you can ask other potential users of a calendar to sign up for their own userid, notify you of their userid (they do not need to give you their password), and then you can add them to a closed calendar.</li>
</ul>
As you may have noticed security is at a minimum with this model. If you have confidential information we do not recommend that you post it to this calendar interface. In addition, you should ask anyone that you create a userid for to change their password the first time they log in.
