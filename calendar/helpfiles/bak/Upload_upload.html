If you are asking, "Why do I have to specify file uploads like this?" - Well, here's the answer:
<p>
This is generally a limitation of the way file handles work with the PHP scripting language. We have chosen to use PHP over Javascript in this case for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>Javascript has security holes.</li>
<li>Javascript must be enabled on the client to run. If it's not enabled, then you would not be able to see this window, or upload files.</li>
</ol>
It would be possible to include multiple "Browse" boxes to allow for more than 1 file upload at a time, but this would be an arbitrary number of files, and might confuse some users. Thus, you may choose one file at a time, it uploads, and then go to the next file. 
<p>
Look for future updates to this page if we rewrite file handles for PHP, or if a future version of PHP has a way to easily get around this issue.
