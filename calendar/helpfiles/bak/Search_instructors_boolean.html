When using this search each item that you choose is "AND'ed" during the search. This means that in order for something to be true all the conditions you choose must be met. Thus, if you chose the Region 'Africa' AND the Language 'Russian' AND 'Wireless Topics' as a teaching topic, then in order for someone to appear in the search results they must have listed one of their languages as Russian, must live in the Arican region, and have indicated that they can teach Wireless Topics.
<p>
Note that you can use this form to search on individual items. Thus, if you simply want to see every teacher who speaks French you can just choose this option from the Language menu. Or, you could choose the language 'French' and the region 'Europe' to find all people who live in the European region and speak French.
