Why are we requiring this information? the goal of this site is to provide network training materials for use by instructors, workshops, presenters, and students. In order to help these individuals find these materials we need to have enough information on each set of items that are uploaded so that meaningful searches can be conducted by others to find these items once uploaded. Below is a short description of why each particular item is required:
<ul>
<li><b>Title:</b> A good descriptive title can certainly help someone to understand what your materials are about at first glance. And, a title is essential to allow for listings of materials during search results.</li>
<li><b>Author(s):</b> This is to ensure that the original author or authors of these items are properly credited. It is possible that you are uploading items for someone else. In addition, these persons may not have an account in our system, so this is the only way to ensure proper credit is given. If you are the original author, please fill in your name as you use it on this site.</li>
<li><b>Date:</b> Without this we have no way of knowing for what timeframe these materials are relevant. You may be uploading past materials, thus the upload date does not tell us an appropriate date for these materials. In addition, users may search for materials based on date.</li>
<li><b>Languages:</b> We provide a primary language box here. If your materials are in more than one language, please place the alternate language box provided. We, however, recommend that if you have materials in more than one language that you upload each set of materials separately by language. Language will be one of the most important search items for many people looking for items in their local language. If your materials are in a language the user does not understand, then it is critical that the language be indicated for materials so that they can choose items that work for them. And, yes, we understand the irony of all this as this site is currently in English. We are working towards providing this site in other languages as well.</li>
<li><b>Topics:</b> We are aware that there is no way to capture every possible topic, or to be specific enough. But, this is a first method to be able to classify items. Many users will search for materials by topic. If none of our topic choices work, please enter in a topic in the Alternate Topic box provided. If you see a missing topic item we should include please let us know by sending email to admin@ws.edu.isoc.org.</li>
</ul>
If you have a URL that points to a location where these materials are located, possibly updated, etc. that can be very useful. Possibly more useful are any additional comments you are willing to provide to better describe the materials you are uploading. In search results comments can be very useful for users searching for specific types of training materials.
