If you check this box, then you can choose files that you have previously uploaded, or you can choose a different file with the same filename of a previously uploaded file. Your original file will be overwritten. We do not allow filenames that are identical for a single Materials item. 
<p>
This box is unchecked by default. The assumption is that you have either pressed your Browser's reload button, thus making it look as if you wish to upload the same file(s) again, or that you have mistakenly chosen the same file as before. When this happens an error message is generated and no files are uploaded.
<p>
<b>Additional notes:</b>
<ol>
<li>If you check this box, but don't choose any files of the same name, then the files you choose will be uploaded and nothing will be replaced.<//li>
<li>If you choose the same file more than once, then that file <i>will not</i> be uploaded. Duplicate filename check for files chosen overrides the "Replace files" checkbox. You need to rename one of the files to a different name first.</li>
<li>If you were to choose two, or more, files of the same name, but that are different files, then the last file chosen is the one you will end up with, which leads to</li>
<li>If you have two, or more, separate files by the same name you should rename one, or more, of the files before uploading them.</li>
